## Scope

### 1. Inventory Management
- **Stock Tracking**: Maintain an up-to-date record of all medical equipment, medications, and consumables.
- **Automated Alerts**: Generate alerts for low stock levels, expiration dates, and replenishment requirements.
- **Procurement Management**: Simplify the procurement process for inventory, ensuring cost efficiency and timely restocking.
- **Usage Analytics**: Provide detailed reports and analytics on inventory usage to identify trends and optimize resources.
- **Waste Reduction**: Minimize waste by monitoring expiry dates and ensuring proper utilization of inventory items.

## Inventory Management Plan

1. Captures perishability of this life-saving product through the use of arc multipliers.
2. Contains discarding costs associated with waste/disposal.
3. Handles uncertainty associated with demand points.
4. Assesses costs associated with shortages/surpluses at the demand points.
5. Quantifies the supply-side risk associated with procurement.
